# BlackJack

Blackjack app built in a week to learn functional-based programming.

## Software

- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

### Notes

Early attempts at functional programming, uploaded for posterity. Improvements would be to utilise setTimeout and animations for clarity to user. Also relies on a "while" loops, which can cause bugs. However, good to see as shows how much my JS coding and CSS has improved.
